# DNA-to-Protein
Simple Python script to aid the user at transcribing and translating an DNA chain to an RNA gene and subsequently to a chain of aminoacids, that is, a protein. To execute type on a terminal:

	python3 Genes_v1.0.0.py
  
 As long as python3 is used to execute it, everything is fine. Translation to English soon to be made.
