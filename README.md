# DNA to Protein
Simple Python script to aid the user at transcribing and translating an DNA chain to an RNA gene and subsequently to a chain of aminoacids, that is, a protein. To execute type on a terminal:

```shell
$ ./Genes_v1.1.0.py
```
  
As long as python3 is used to execute it, it will run properly, thus a GUI will work just as well. 
English and Spanish translations based on the locale of the system, or selected by passing an argument at execution:

```shell
$ ./Genes_v1.1.0.py [es/en]
```
