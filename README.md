# DNA to Protein
Simple Python script to aid the user at transcribing and translating an DNA chain to an RNA gene and subsequently to a chain of aminoacids, that is, a protein. To execute type on a terminal:

```shell
$ python3 Genes_v1.0.0.py   # run the script on python 3
```
  
As long as python3 is used to execute it, it will run properly, thus a GUI will work just as well. Translation in English soon to be made.
